i3:
- Get i3 super riced out with colors n shit
- Work on i3bar configuration (look into i3status)
- Customize i3lock settings

Colors:
    I'm rolling Monokai for now. Update urxvt and i3 to match on linux install.
    Maybe try some things I've seen on unixporn on Linux? OSX is pretty comfy with Monokai.
    To change linux colorscheme:
        - Change i3 colors
        - Change urxvt colors
        - Change vim colorscheme (1 line in vimrc)

install.sh:
- Rewrite me!
