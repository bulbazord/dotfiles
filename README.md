# My doot files

These are my doot files. You are free to use any of my dotfiles as well as modify them to your liking, but you do so at your own risk.

** DISCLAIMER: ** My dot files can and WILL change whenever I feel like it. Don't expect for the changes to react nicely on your system!

## Installation

This is easy. First, clone the repository somewhere on your machine:
	`git clone git@github.com:xiaobai/dotfiles.git dootFiles`

`cd` into the directory:
	`cd dootFiles/`

and run install.sh:
	`source install.sh`

The dotfiles should be symbolically linked to the right places, and should work out of the box if you are using the appropriate software.
