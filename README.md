# My doot files

These are my doot files. You are free to use any of my dotfiles as well as modify them to your liking, but you do so at your own risk.

**DISCLAIMER:** My dot files can and WILL change whenever I feel like it. Installing these can and will replace your current configuration. Don't expect for the changes to react nicely on your system!

## How to bootstrap (OS X)
